# SmileCNN

Smile Detection with a Deep Convolutional Neural Net using [Keras](http://keras.io).

This example is based on the `mnist_cnn.py` example, running at 32x32 instead of 28x28.

To compile the ZMQVideoInput app, [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) is required.

If you want to run the realtime capture with OpenCV and you're using OS X, I recommend using Python via [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and installing OpenCV with:

```
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
```
